# CPSeeker
A prototype of Memory-like function seeker (CPSeeker), a hybrid (static analysis and dynamic analysis) analysis method that identifies the memory copy function in the (stripped) binary executables.


# Research paper

We present our approach and findings of this work in the following research paper: <br>
<strong> Memcpy-Like Function Identification Method with Static and Dynamic Hybrid Analysis </strong> (reviewing)

# Running Environment

Te run code in this reposity, you need the IDA Pro (version 7.5) with Python3 support, Unicorn, pyvex, networkx.
